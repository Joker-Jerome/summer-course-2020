## Inverted Classroom Pedagogy
An inverted classroom is one in which the lecture time is spent doing those tasks which would traditionally take place outside of the classroom and vice versa.
As such, lecture time is spent reviewing problem sets, expounding on concepts with input from students, rather than the didactic relaying of information.
That information transmission is relegated to the students' non-instructional time, through such methods as pre-recorded lectures, exercises or reading material.
This shift in structure requires a different investiture of resources from the student, and as a result the incentives required have been found to shift in response:

1. Reviewing the material provided for each lecture, be it readings, exercises or pre-recorded lectures is crucial for functioning in an inverted classroom.
2. Classroom time is predominantly an exercise in information integration, following both the thread of discussion and relating it to the student's own skill level. Active learning is a must.
3. As such, student reflection and conversing with instructors and making sure skill development is taking apace with the content delivered is a key to successful learning.
